# NfcNci Patience

Add a delay (1000ms by default) to the NFC presence check to accommodate longer NFC smart card operations in AOSP NfcNci implementation on certain devices (see [LineageOS issue #7268](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/7268))

This bug â€”which may sound obscure at first, plagues several apps e.g. the German eID app and most of Indonesian electronic pass (Mandiri e-money, BCA Flazz, etc) recharge apps (failure upon balance update) due to those apps not having sufficient [`EXTRA_READER_PRESENCE_CHECK_DELAY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/NfcAdapter#EXTRA_READER_PRESENCE_CHECK_DELAY) value, which results in the NFC service's assumption that the smart card has been lost.  

## Setup

- Install this module
- Enable this module and ensure that "Nfc Service" (the `com.android.nfc` package) is added to the scope
- Reboot the device for the module to take effect

## Configuration

You can use the provided settings interface to tune the presence check timeout to your needs, provided that they're a whole number ranging from 125 to 5000. You do *not* need to reboot your device for the change to take effect.
